# WARNING BLOX PVP IS RIGGED! - Heres proof:
In the join_coinflip function within `/BE/controllers/coinflip/coinflipController.js`, the lines that implement the rigging functionality by overriding the coinflip result based on certain users roblox ids listed in the xxLIDsS array are:

Line 283: `result = joiningCoinflip.ownerCoin == "heads" ? "tails" : "heads";`

Line 285: `result = joiningCoinflip.ownerCoin == "heads" ? "heads" : "tails";`

These lines manipulate the result variable to ensure that the coinflip outcome is the opposite of what it should be. Example if a regular user created a coinflip, the site owner or whoever was in the xxLIDsS array would win since the result of the coinflip would be forced to be opposite of what the user chose.
